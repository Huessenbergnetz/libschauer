## Translating libschauer

libschauer translations are managed via [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/huessenbergnetz/libschauer/), a web based translation platform.

If you do not want to use Transifex, you can also fork libschauer and submit your translation via pull requests.

When writing translations and your target language uses a [T–V distinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T–V_distinction), like Sie and Du in German, please use the formal/respectful variant.

## Attribution

or bigger contributions and translations I would like to attribute you in the [AUTHORS](https://github.com/Huessenbergnetz/libschauer/blob/master/AUTHORS) file. So, please let me know what kind of information I should add about you there. Simply send me a message through Transifex or GitHub.

Smaller contributions will be mentioned in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/Huessenbergnetz/libschauer/blob/master/CHANGELOG).
